The current model, asdetailed below, includes the formation of the GRB jet and its evolution, aswell as the charged particle acceleration processes that occurs and theradiation generated by those particles.\subsection{Jet Dynamics}\begin{figure}[h]  \centering  \cfig{2}{gammaEvo.pdf}{4}  \caption{The expansion phases and radii of an expanding GRB jet.}\end{figure}\subsubsection{Initial Explosion Energetics}Assume that an explosion of a stellar mass object deposits an energy$E_0 \approx 10^{50}-10^{52}$ ergs into a volume $\frac{4}{3}\pir_0^2$ \cite{Kobayashi:1999}. Taking the progenitor of the GRB to bethe collapse of either a super-massive star or the coalescence of twocompact objects, $r_0$ can be assumed to be the within an order ofmagnitude of the Schwarzschild radius of a black hole. This explosionoccurs over a timescale of a few seconds. The Eddington luminosity,\begin{equation}  \label{eq:eddington}  L_E\;\equiv\;4\pi G M m_p c/\sigma_T\;=\; 1.25\;\times\;10^{38}(M/M_{sun})\;erg\;s^{-1} %%% Fix this\end{equation}is the maximum luminosity at which radiation pressure and self-gravityform a hydrostatic equilibrium \cite{rybicki:1979}. For the energies andtimescales above, the Eddington luminosity is greatly exceeded and radiationpressure forces an expansion of the fireball.The velocity of the expansion is governed by the specific entropy ofthe fireball:\begin{equation}  \eta\;\equiv\;\frac{E_0}{M_0 c^2},\end{equation}where $M_0$ is the initial baryonic mass of the jet. This specificentropy of the jet will be the maximum Lorentz expansion can obtain(see \sectionref{sec:eoj}). If the fireball contains a high fractionof baryonic mass, i.e., $\eta\approx\;1$, then the expansion will besubrelativistic corresponding to a Sedov-Taylor expansion\cite{Sedov:1946,Taylor:1950}. Conversely, a low baryon load willcause a relativistic expansion. Observational evidence forrelativistic expansion exists due to the presence of high-energy{\gray}s. For high photon densities, the photon-photon collisionalcross-section is large for high-energy photons. It is however, afunction of photon propagation angle. If the fireball expandsrelativistically, the photons will be beamed which reduces thephoton-photon annihilation cross-section due to the small collisionalangle of the nearly parallel photons.. Therefore, the measurement ofhigh-energy {\gray}s provides strong evidence for relativisticexpansion and the baryon load is assumed to be small, i.e., $\eta\gg1$.An explosion which imparts an energy $E_0$ into a mass$M_0\ll\frac{E_0}{c^2}$ within a radius $r_0$ results and arelativistically expanding fireball is formed\cite{Blandford:1976}. This kinetic energy input energizes theparticles in the outflow to have initial random Lorentz factors$\gamma_0=\eta$. There are three relevant phases of the jet that willbe focused on; corresponding to specific radii of the outflow. Theseinclude the acceleration phase, which occurs before the saturationradius, $r_s$, the thermalization phase, corresponding with thephotospheric radius, $r_{ph}$, and the optically-thin coasting phase,where non-thermal radiation is likely to occur at $r_{nt}$.\subsubsection{Acceleration of the Jet}\label{sec:eoj}Due to the relativistic velocities and initial high densitiesinvolved, the fireball initially expands adiabatically. Adiabaticexpansion occurs when a volume of fluid expands without heat exchangewith its environment, typically when the expansion happens rapidlyand/or when the fluid is thermally insulated from the surroundingenvironment. The deposit of energy into the fluid is rapid and theearly stages of the jet are extremely dense, sufficiently insulatingthe plasma. From thermodynamics, we know that a relativisticallyexpanding gas dominated by radiation has an adiabatic index of$\gamma_{\rm a}=4/3$. It is convenient to work in the rest or comovingframe of the jet where the volume expands isotropically and thenLorentz boost into the observer frame at the end. I will use a primeto indicate quantities in the comoving frame ($x^{\prime}$) from thispoint forward. The comoving volume, $V^{\prime}$, and comovingtemperature, $T^{\prime}$ are related via $T^{\prime} \proptoV^{\prime 1-\gamma_{\rm a}}$, from simple thermodynamics. In thecomoving frame, $V^{\prime} \propto r^3$ \cite{Meszaros:1993} whichleads to $T^{\prime} \propto r^{-1}$. The particles in the outflowhave random Lorentz factors $\gamma^{\prime} \propto T^{\prime}$giving their radial evolution as $\gamma^{\prime} \propto r^{-1}$ asthe jet expands. Therefore, we see that after the initial input ofenergy, $E_0$, into the particles, the particles will cool during theexpansion and that energy accelerates the jet.The bulk Lorentz factor, $\Gamma$, of the outflow must increase tobalance the cooling of the particles. To conserve energy, the kineticenergy per particle and the bulk Lorentz factor must balance eachother, i.e.,  $\gamma\Gamma = {\rm constant}$ which instantly yields theevolution of the fireball's bulk expansion velocity, $\Gamma \proptor$. The acceleration of the fireball continues until $\Gamma = \eta =E_0/{M_0 c^2}$. This is because there is no more energy is availablefor expansion. Theoutflow is said to saturate at this point and the radius is referredto as the saturation radius, $r_{\rm s}$, after which $\Gamma$ coastsat a constant value \cite{Paczynski:1986,Goodman:1986,Shemi:1990}.\subsubsection{The Photosphere}The energies and volumes involved in the fireball scenario imply ahigh particle and photon density initially. These high densities implythat the outflow is optically thick for some part of its evolution\cite{Paczynski:1986,Goodman:1986,Shemi:1990}. Initially, the plasmacontains a large number of $e^{\pm}$ pairs that are in thermodynamicequilibrium with the photons. These drop out of equilibrium very deepwithin the jet. These pairs could lead to a photosphere but only if$\Gamma\gg1000$. When these pairs "freeze-out" of the plasma, therenumber is much less than pairs coupled to baryons in the flow\cite{Goodman:1986}.  The baryons in the fireball carry $e^{\pm}$pairs with them which serve as scattering centers for thephotons. Additionally, pairs can be produced by photon collisionswhich can contribute to the overall opacity. If we consider theoutflow to be a wind of varying density as a function of radius thenthe opacity properties can be assessed using relativistic fluidequations \cite{Paczynski:1990}. The flow has a dimensionless entropy$\eta=L/\dot{M}c^2$ and baryon density\begin{equation}  \label{eq:pdensity}  n^{\prime}_p\;=\;\dot{M}/4 \pi r^2 m_p c \Gamma \end{equation}which can be rewritten\begin{equation}  \label{eq:pdensity2}   n^{\prime}_p\;=\;L/ 4 \pi r^2 m_p c^3 \eta \Gamma.\end{equation}The majority of the electrons in the flow at this point are thosewhich are are coupled to the baryons, i.e.,$n^{\prime}_p=n^{\prime}_e$. To calculate the optical depth, theelectron density multiplied by the Thomson electron-photon scatteringcross-section, $\sigma_{\rm T}$, must be integrated along the line ofsight. The optical depth as a function of radius is\cite{Paczynski:1990}:\begin{equation}  \tau(r)\;=\;\int_r^{\infty}n^{\prime}_e \sigma_{\rm T}\left(\frac{1-\beta_v}{1+\beta_v}\right)^{1/2}dr^{\prime}\;\simeq\;n^{\prime}_e \sigma_{\rm T}(r/2 \Gamma).\end{equation}Here, $\beta_v=v/c$ is the dimensionless velocity of the outflow. Thefireball becomes optically thin with $\tau\approx1$ (but see\cite{peer:2008} for cases where the photosphere is not a constantsurface) at the photospheric radius, $r_{\rm ph}$. Solving for $r_{\rm  ph}$ by setting $\tau=1$ yields\begin{equation}  \label{eq:rph} r_{\rm ph}\;=\;\frac{ L \sigma_{\rm T}}{8 \pi m_p c^3 \eta \Gamma^2}.\end{equation}The photosphere can occur above or below the saturation radiusdepending on the value of $\eta$. High values of $\eta$ force thephotosphere below $r_s$. This work will focus on values of $\eta$ suchthat $r_s<r_{ph}$. The temperature evolution in this region is simply\cite{Meszaros:1993}\begin{equation}  \label{eq:ktevo}  T^{\prime}\propto \left(\dover{r}{r_s}\right)^{-2/3}.\end{equation}When the jet becomes optically thin at $r_{ph}$, the photon emissionshould be in the form of a blackbody.\subsection{Non-Thermal Emission Region}\label{sec:nter}The vast majority of GRB spectra are observed to be non-thermal\cite{Goldstein:2012}. Details of these observations will be discussedin \sectionref{sec:spectrum}. The source and process of thisnon-thermal emission is yet to be fully understood. To understand thisproblem, not only do the radiative processes that produce the$\gamma$-ray emission have to be identified, but also the mechanismsthat accelerated the emitting particles to non-thermal energies. Forthis work, it will be assumed that the non-thermal emission occurs inan optically thin regime, i.e. when $r>r_{ph}$. There are twomacrophysical proceess that serve to extract kinetic energy of theoutflow and convert it into radiation at these radii: internal shocks,and external shocks. Magnetic reconnection is another process that canextract energy from the flow, but it extracts magnetic energy and willbe discussed in \sectionref{sec:MR}.\subsubsection{Internal  Shocks}\label{sec:nter:is}The observed non-thermal shape of the broadband emission of GRBsimplies a non-thermal distribution of the emitting electrons. Thecommonly-invoked method for generating non-thermal electrondistributions is the Fermi process by which electrons are acceleratedto high non-thermal energies. The details of the particle accelerationare discussed below in \sectionref{sec:pa::fp}. However, it is important todiscuss the properties of the jet that can lead to particleacceleration. If it is assumed that random variations in $\Gamma$ formin the early stages of the jet then these variations can lead tointernal shocks \cite{Rees:1994,Daigne:1998}. These variations formfrom random changes in the mass loss rate, $\dot{M}$, and are of orderunity, i.e., $\Delta \dot{M}/\dot{M}\sim 1$ . The variations will be spatially separated by $c t_v$, where$t_v$ is the variability timescale of the central engine. These stratified portions of thewind or \emph{shells} will catch up with one another at a radius$r_{nt} \sim c t_v \Gamma^2$. This can occur above or below $r_{ph}$depending on the internal properties of the jet. For $r_{nt}<r_{ph}$energy will be dissipated into the thermalizing electrons. Thisscenario will be further detailed in \sectionref{sec:subpht}.To understand the properties of internal shocks occurring above thephotosphere, consider two shells denoted by their masses and bulkLorentz factors $m_{\rm s}$, $\Gamma_{\rm s}$ and $m_{\rm f}$,$\Gamma_{\rm f}$ where $\Gamma_{\rm f} > \Gamma_{\rm s}$. When thefaster shell catches up with the slower shell and inelastic collisionoccurs creating a merged shell with a resulting Lorentz factor\begin{equation}\label{eq:intshock}\Gamma_{\rm m} \sim \sqrt{\frac{m_{\rm f} \Gamma_{\rm f} + m_{\rm s} \Gamma_{\rm s}}{{m_{\rm f} /\Gamma_{\rm f}}+m_{\rm s}/ \Gamma_{\rm s}}}\end{equation}by way of conservation of kinetic energy and momentum\cite{Daigne:1998}. The internal energy available for the electrons toradiate or be accelerated to high-energies is given by the differenceof the kinetic energy before and after the collision:\begin{equation}  \label{eq:intEne}  E_{\rm int}=m_{\rm f} c^2 (\Gamma_{\rm f}-\Gamma_{\rm m})+m_{\rm s}c^2(\Gamma_{\rm s}-\Gamma_{\rm m}).\end{equation}%%%% MORE HERE!!While internal shocks present a viable option for extracting energyfrom the outflow for radiation, several drawbacks exist that haveyet to be resolved. Foremost, internal shocks are extremelyinefficient at converting bulk energy into radiation. The efficiencyof the process is given by\begin{equation}  \label{eq:eff}  {\rm eff} = 1 - \dover{(m_{\rm f} + m_{\rm s})}{\sqrt{m_{\rm f}^2+m_{\rm s}^2 +m_{\rm f}m_{\rm s}\left( \dover{\Gamma_{\rm f}}{\Gamma_{\rm s}} +  \dover{\Gamma_{\rm s}}{\Gamma_{\rm f}}   \right)}}\end{equation}which is only on the order of 5-20\% for a typical collision speed\cite{Daigne:1998,Guetta:2001}. This range of efficiencies can bemodified by changing the value of $r_{nt}$ or more directly, theinitial variation in $\Gamma$ \cite{Spada:2000,Beloborodov:2003}.  Theextremely high luminosities observed in GRBs require an immense amountof radiation to be generated and the low efficiency of the internalshock process places severe limits on the radiation processes thatmust occur.\subsection{External Shocks}An external shock occurs when the outflow material in the jet collideswith the external interstellar medium (ISM) or the layers of materialpreviously blown off by the progenitor star with density $\rho_{\rm  ext}$. The external matter is swept up by the jet producing a blastwave \cite{Rees:1992}. A shock is formed at the velocity discontinuityand propagates forward with a Lorentz factor $2^{1/2} \Gamma$\cite{Blandford:1976}.  The shock becomes important when the amount ofenergy in swept up material is roughly equal to the energy of theoutflow:\begin{equation}  \label{eq:extShockE}  E_0 \sim \dover{4 \pi}{3} \rho_{ext} \Gamma^2 r_{dec}^3,\end{equation}at a deceleration radius $r_{dec}$. The bulk velocity of the jet willdecrease to half its original value at this point and have swept up amass approximately $M_{ext}\sim M_0/\Gamma$ \cite{Rees:1992}. Thedeceleration causes a reverse shock to form and propagate back intothe jet which dissipates energy to the particles in the outflow. This energyis free to be radiated in the form of a GRB via synchrotron orinverse-Compton processes.External shocks have been shown to be not viable for generating theprompt non-thermal radiation in GRBs due to several factors. Namely,external shocks cannot recreate the short-timescale variabilityobserved in GRB lightcurves \cite{Sari:1997}. They are brieflyreviewed here for completeness.% It has been suggested that a part of the prompt emission could be due% to emission from an external shock \cite{}. The emission is in the% form of the so-called early afterglow. The afterglow is x-ray emission% that occurs after the prompt phase and can last for several days \cite{}. The% source of afterglow emission is almost certainly an external shock \cite{}.\section{Particle Acceleration Processes}As noted in \sectionref{sec:nter}, the observed non-thermal shape ofGRB spectra require the acceleration of the radiating particles tonon-thermal energies. The two main physical processes that canaccelerate these particle in GRB environs are the Fermi process andmagnetic reconnection.  While the Fermi process has been studied andsimulated extensively, the framework of magnetic reconnection in thecontext of GRBs is still poorly understood and its application istypically only to alleviate problems arising from the Fermiacceleration. Here the two processes are reviewed.  \subsection{The Fermi Process}\label{sec:pa::fp}First posed by Enrico Fermi \cite{Fermi:1949}, the Fermi process's usein high-energy astrophysics is ubiquitous. The mechanism is thecentral theoretical underpinning of cosmic-ray generation and wasfully developed in the 1970's\cite{Axford:1981,Krymskii:1977,Blandford:1978,Bell:1978b,Bell:1978a}. Thetheory was extended to the ultra-relativistic regime in the 1980's\cite{Kirk:1989,Kirk:1987} and has been theorized as a viablemechanism to accelerate charges in GRB outflows. Two forms of theprocess exist, first- and second-order acceleration, referring to theorder of the particle velocity ($u$ and $u^2$) to which the energygain is proportional.\subsubsection{First-Order Acceleration}First order Fermi acceleration is a process by which fast charges in ashock wave cross the shock boundary. A velocity discontinuity existsbetween a fast and slow region of material, referred to as the upstreamand downstream regions respectively (see \figureref{fig:fermiaccel}).\begin{figure}[h]  \centering  \cfig{2}{fermiaccel.pdf}{4}  \caption{An illustration of the    first-order Fermi process. Charges are reflected between the up    and downstream regions, gaining energy proportional to $u$. }\label{fig:fermiaccel}\end{figure}The relative velocity of the two regions is $u=\beta_v c$.  Assumethat the charges in the up and downstream fluid are initially inthermal distribution. Suprathermal charges (charges with a highvelocity compared with the bulk of the distribution i.e., those in theexponential tail of the distribution) can escape ahead of the shockfront, where they see converging scattering centers in the form ofother charges with a velocity relative to the escaped charge. Theseescaped charges will be reflected back across the shock boundary bythe scattering centers where they will once again see convergingscattering centers in the new region. This cycle can occur many times,each resulting in a systematic energy gain of $u/c$. Therefore,first-order Fermi acceleration can result in particles gaining asubstantial amount of energy compared to their original thermaldistribution \cite{longair}. Relativistic, first-order accelerationworks generally in the same manner and results in charges beingenergized into a high-energy power-law. It has been shown that theindex of the electron energy power-law is $\delta \approx 2.2 -2.3$\cite{Ostrowski:2002,Waxman:1997,Bednarz:1998,Achterberg:2001}.A key problem in first-order acceleration is how to have enoughsuprathermal particles serving as a pool for acceleration tosufficiently populate the observed non-thermal distribution. This isknown as the injection problem. In addition, the question of whethershocks can generate in situ the conditions necessary for accelerationto occur. Monte carlo simulations and analytic simplifications of bothrelativistic and non-relativistic shock acceleration have relied onplacing shock conditions and magnetic fields in by hand to validatethe process\cite{Baring:2012,Baring:2011,Baring:1995,Ellison:1990,Ellison:2004}.The success of these efforts begs the question of whether the shockconditions can be self generated.  Recent numerical simulation workhas attempted to address these problems and confirms that first-orderFermi acceleration is possible in realistic, relativistic shocks\cite{Spitkovsky:2008}.\begin{figure}[h]  \centering  \cfig{2}{slowE.pdf}{4}  \caption{Post-shock electron distribution consisting of a    relativistic Maxwellian and a high-energy power-law tail.}\end{figure}The general form of the post-shock particle distribution is that ofrelativistic Maxwellian with a high-energy power-law tail\cite{Baring:2012,Baring:2011,Baring:1995,Ellison:1990,Ellison:2004,Spitkovsky:2008}:\begin{equation}  n_e(\gamma )\; =\; n_{0} \biggl\lbrack\;  \Bigl( \dover{\gamma}{\gamth} \Bigr)^2\,  e^{-\gamma/\gamth } + \epsilon \,  \Bigl( \dover{\gamma}{\gamth} \Bigr)^{-\delta}\,  \Theta \Bigl( \dover{\gamma}{\gammaMin} \Bigr)\, \biggr\rbrack\, .  \label{eq:elec_dist}\end{equation}This distribution is crucial to this work because it serves as thefoundation for the physical modeling of GRB spectra that will beapplied to data.\subsubsection{Second-Order Acceleration}Second-order Fermi acceleration is a process by which charges arereflected off magnetic turbulence, which can be conceptualized asmagnetic clouds moving in random directions with a mean velocity$u=\lvert\vec{u}\rvert=\beta_v c$. The overall effect of these randomscatterings is a stochastic gain in energy proportional to $u^2$. Theenergy gain is much smaller than the first-order process, but is stillrelevant to GRB particle acceleration as an attempt to solve theso-called fast-cooling problem (see \sectionref{sec:spec:lod,sec:ascp}). The process isalso much slower than first-order acceleration.\subsection{Magnetic Reconnection}\label{sec:MR}While extensive analytic and numerical studies of the Fermi processhave had some success in attempting to explain the non-thermal spectraof GRBs, particle acceleration via magnetic reconnection remains aplausible theoretical avenue as well\cite{zhang:2011,Meszaros:1997b,Meszaros:1994,Thompson:1994,Usov:1994}.The progenitor of a GRB can have a strong initial magnetic field,e.g., as in the collision of two highly-magnetized neutron stars. Ifit is assumed that the GRB jet ejects a highly-magnetized orPoynting-flux-dominated (PDF) outflow, then the observed $\gamma$-rayemission could result from the release of this magnetic energy when itis transferred to charged particles in the jet and then radiated away.The main process for releasing stored magnetic energy is via magneticreconnection. The details of magnetic reconnection are not wellunderstood; however, the basic mechanism occurs when two magneticregions of opposite orientation approach each other and then reconnectvia the so-called Sweet-Parker process\cite{Parker:1957,Sweet:1958}. This classical scenario occurs over atimescale that is far too slow to explain the rapid variability seenin GRB events. Recently, a new mechanism was proposed, and verified bynumerical simulations, in which reconnection can occur over a rapidtimescale in the presence of magnetic turbulence\cite{Kowal:2009,Lazarian:1999}. The release of this magnetic energyserves to accelerate particles non-thermally as well as tointroduce turbulence into the surrounding magnetic field.  This inturn can serve to accelerate particles via the second-order Fermiprocess.\section{Emission Mechanisms}\label{sec:emissionMech}While it is critical to understand the processes that govern thedynamics of the jet and energize the electrons, ultimately theradiative mechanisms that produce the observed radiation are key tounderstanding the observed $\gamma$-ray flux. A review of the relevantnon-thermal radiative processes follows. These include synchrotron andinverse-Compton radiation.\subsection{Synchrotron}\label{sec:synctheory}Electrons in the presence of a magnetic field ($\vec{B}$) are accelerated by the Lorentz force:\begin{equation}\label{eq:FL}  \vec{F_L}=\dover{d}{dt}(\gamma_e m \vec{v})=q\left(\vec{E} +\dover{1}{c} \vec{v}\times \vec{B} \right)\end{equation}where $\gamma_e$ is the Lorentz factor of the electron\cite{rybicki:1979,jackson:1998}. For the plasmas considered in thiswork, the electric field ($\vec{E}$) is typically shorted out andtherefore $\vec{E}=0$. The force of the magnetic field on the particlecauses a gyration.  Assume that the electrons lose little energy pergyration implying $\gamma_e\neq \gamma_e(t)$. With these assumptions\equationref{eq:FL} can be rewritten \begin{equation}   \label{eq:FL2}   \dover{d \vec{v}}{dt}=\omega_B\left( \vec{v} \times \dover{\vec{B}}{B} \right) \end{equation}where\begin{equation}  \label{eq:cycfreq}  \omega_B = \frac{qB}{\gamma_e m_e c}.\end{equation}Accelerated charges emit radiation with power, P, calculated via the Lamour formula:\begin{equation}  \label{eq:Psync}  P=\dover{2 q^2}{3 c^3}\gamma_e^2\omega_B^2v^2=\dover{4}{3}\sigma_{\rm T}c\beta_v^2\gamma_e^2\dover{B^2}{8 \pi}.\end{equation}This radiationis called synchrotron radiation. In GRB studies, synchrotron radiation is theorized to be emitted bythe distribution of electrons, $n_e$, that have been accelerated inthe jet by one of the processes described above. To calculate thesynchrotron energy flux, $F_{\nu}$ (erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$), emittedby a distribution of electrons ($n_e(\gamma)$), the single particleemissivity of synchrotron radiation \cite{rybicki:1979},\begin{equation}  \mathcal{F}\left(w\right) \; =\; w \int_w^{\infty } K_{5/3}(x) \, dx,  \label{eq:synch_func}\end{equation}expressed here in dimensionless form must be convolved with $n_e(\gamma)$ over all energies, i.e., \begin{equation}  F_{\nu}(\mathcal{E})\; \propto\; \int_1^{\infty} n_e(\gamma ) \,   \mathcal{F} \left( \dover{\mathcal{E}}{E_c}\right) \, d\gamma\quad .  \label{eq:synch_flux}\end{equation}The quantity $E_c$ is called the characteristic energy of emission andis defined\begin{equation}  \label{eq:wc}  E_c(\gamma) = \frac{3 \gamma^2q \hbar B \sin\alpha}{2 m_e c}.\end{equation}With \equationref{eq:Psync,eq:synch_flux,eq:wc} the full synchrotronspectrum can be derived for any distribution of electrons. Ofparticular interest  due to its prevalence in nature and the factthat Fermi acceleration generates a power-law(see \sectionref{sec:pa::fp}), is the synchrotron spectrum from a power-lawdistribution of electrons. Let\begin{equation}  \label{eq:plelec}  n_e^{pl}=n_0(\delta -1)\gamma_{\rm min}^{\delta-1}\gamma^{\delta}, \gamma_{\rm min} \leq \gamma\end{equation}where $\delta$ is the electron spectral index of the power-law. The $\Fv$ synchrotron spectrum of from this distribution can be described asymptotically described by\begin{equation}  \label{eq:plsync}  F_{\nu}(\mathcal{E})\propto\left\{     \begin{array}{lr}       \mathcal{E}^{1/3} & : \mathcal{E}\leq E_{\rm p}\\       \mathcal{E}^{-\frac{1-\delta}{2}} & : \mathcal{E}>E_{\rm p}     \end{array}.   \right.\end{equation}with a peak energy calculated from \equationref{eq:wc},\begin{equation}  \label{eq:synchPeak}  E_{\rm p} = \frac{3 \gamma_{\rm min}^2 q \hbar B \sin{\alpha}}{2 m_e c}.\end{equation}The 1/3 index below the peak of the spectrum holds for the majority ofphysical electron distributions. However, electrons will lose asignificant amount of their energy via synchrotron radiation. Thiscooling can alter the initial $n_e(\gamma)$ and therefore we nowconsider the synchrotron spectrum from electrons that have beensignificantly cooled.The cooling of the electron distribution is inevitable when there isno source of heating because synchrotron is a highly efficientradiator. Adapting from the derivation of \cite{Burgess:2013}(hereafter B13), assume that electrons distributed as in\equationref{eq:plelec} are injected via and acceleration process intoa region where they are allowed to cool by the emission of synchrotronradiation. The cooling of the electrons is governed by the continuityequation \cite{Blumenthal:1970}\begin{equation}  \label{eq:komp}  \frac{\partial n_e(\gamma,t)}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial}{\partial \gamma}[\dot{\gamma}n_e(\gamma,t)]+\frac{n_e(\gamma,t)}{t_{esc}}\;=\;Q_e(\gamma)\end{equation}where $n_e/t_{esc}$ represents the loss of particles from the emissionregion from which we can define the maximal cooling scale$\gamma/\dot{\gamma}\;\sim\;t_{esc}$ and $Q_e$ is the injection term. This corresponds to a Lorentzfactor, $\gamma_{\rm cool}$, below which cooling shuts off. For very highelectron Lorentz factors, $\gamma/\dot{\gamma}\;\ll\;t_{esc}$ andtherefore the loss term can be neglected, i.e., the dynamicaltimescale is much longer than the radiative timescale. With thisassumption, we can simplify \equationref{eq:komp} to becometime independent. The resulting electron distribution can then easilybe solved\begin{equation}  \label{eq:simpKomp}  n_e(\gamma,t)\;\approx\;\frac{1}{\dot{\gamma}}\int_{\gamma}^{\infty}Q_e(\gamma')d\gamma'.\end{equation}Substituting in the synchrotron cooling rate,\begin{equation}  \label{synchCool}  \dot{\gamma}\;=\;-\frac{\pi}{3}\frac{r_0c}{r_g^2}\gamma^2,\end{equation}where $r_g\;=\;m_ec^2/(eB)$ and $r_e\;=\;e^2/(m_ec^3)$, \equationref{eq:simpKomp} yields the synchrotron-cooled brokenpower-law distribution of electrons (see \figureref{fig:fastE})\begin{equation}  \label{eq:necool}  n_e^{cool}\;\propto\;\frac{q_e\gammaMin}{\gamma^2}\;\min\left\{\left(\frac{\gamma}{\gammaMin}\right)^{-(\delta-1)},1\right\}\;,\;\gamma_{cool}\leq\gamma.\end{equation}Convolving this distribution with the single-particle synchrotronemissivity yields an energy flux spectrum\begin{equation}  \label{eq:coolSynch}   F_{\nu}^{\rm cool}(\mathcal{E})\propto\left\{     \begin{array}{lr}       \mathcal{E}^{1/3} & : \mathcal{E}\leq E_{\rm p}\\       \mathcal{E}^{-1/2} & : E_{cool}<\mathcal{E}\leq E_{\rm p}\\       \mathcal{E}^{-\delta/2} & : \mathcal{E}>E_{\rm p}{\rm p}     \end{array}.   \right.\end{equation}Here, $E_{\rm cool}$ is cooling energy of the energy flux spectrum corresponding to $\gamma_{\rm cool}$, i.e., \begin{equation}  \label{eq:Ec}  E_{\rm cool}= \frac{3 \gamma_{\rm cool}^2 q \hbar B \sin{\alpha}}{2 m_e c}.\end{equation}\begin{figure}[t]  \centering  \cfig{2}{fastE.pdf}{4}  \caption{The resulting    electron distribution resulting from the synchrotron cooling of a    shock injected power-law electron distribution. The distance    between $\gamma_{\rm cool}$ and $\gamma_{\rm min}$ is dependent on    the amount of time the electrons have been allowed to cool.}\label{fig:fastE}\end{figure}\begin{figure}[ht]  \centering  \cfig{2}{sync.pdf}{4}  \caption{The energy flux spectrum of synchrotron  ({\emph red}) and fast-cooling synchrotron ({\emph blue}).}\end{figure}For this distribution of electrons (\equationref{eq:necool}), thelow-energy spectral index of the $\gamma$-ray emission is 1/2, whichis steeper than that of the un-cooled electrons. This difference inemitted spectral indices will be crucial for interpreting theobservations of GRB spectra in order to determine models of emission.\subsection{Inverse Compton}The process of Compton scattering occurs when a photon inelasticallyscatters with an relativistic electron and changes energy anddirection to conserve momentum \cite{rybicki:1979}. The inverse ofthis process occurs when the electron has a high kinetic energycompared to the scattering photon and some of this energy is transfered to the photon. This process is called inverse Comptonscattering. This mechanism is of importance to GRBs because it ispossible that low-energy seed photons of energy $\mathcal{E}_s$ present inthe outflow from thermal emission are scattered to $\gamma$-rayenergies by electrons concurrently existing in the outflow. The seedphotons could even come from the synchrotron radiation generated bythe electrons themselves. This is called synchrotron self-Comptonemission.Considering only inverse Compton in optically thin environs, the $\Fv$spectrum can be calculated by convolving the single-particlescattering kernel with the given electron distribution\cite{rybicki:1979,Baring:2004}:\begin{equation}  \label{eq:ic}  F_{\nu}^{\rm IC}(\mathcal{E}) = \dover{3 \mathcal{E}}{4}\sigma_{T}\int_0^{\infty}d\mathcal{E}_s n_{\rm ph}(\mathcal{E}_s)\int_{\gamma_{\rm min}}^{\infty}\gamma n_e(\gamma)\dover{f(z)}{4 \gamma^2 \mathcal{E}_s}\end{equation}where $n_{\rm ph}$ is the ambient photon field, and the function\begin{equation}  \label{eq:fz}  f(z)=(2z+\ln z+z+1-2z^2)\Theta(z),\;\;z=\dover{\mathcal{E}}{4 \gamma^2 \mathcal{E}_s}\end{equation}is the angle averaged scattering kernel and the Heaviside stepfunction $\Theta(z)=1$ for $0\le z \le 1$ and $\Theta(z)=0$otherwise. The high-energy portion of the spectrum is related to theindex of the electron power-law the same as with synchrotronemission. However, the low-energy portion of the spectrum can be muchharder than with synchrotron, depending on the seed photondistribution. For a mono-energetic photon source scattering on apower-law electron source, the asymptotic energy flux spectrum can bewritten\begin{equation}  \label{eq:icflux}   F_{\nu}(\mathcal{E})\propto\left\{     \begin{array}{lr}       \mathcal{E} & : \mathcal{E}\ll \mathcal{E}_s \gamma_{min}^2\\       \mathcal{E}^{-\frac{1-\delta}{2} }& : \mathcal{E}\gg \mathcal{E}_s \gamma_{min}^2     \end{array}.   \right.\end{equation}Inverse Compton emission of GRBs is attractive because no magneticfield is required to be present in the jet, unlike synchrotronemission. However, if the source of GRB non-thermal emission in the 10keV - 10 MeV range is from inverse-Compton emission, then there shouldbe no observable synchrotron emission at optical wavelengths. Thiscontradicts many observations \cite{}.If a magnetic field is present in the outflow, the electrons willradiate synchrotron photons that the electrons can ``upscatter'' tohigher energies. The so-called synchrotron self-Compton emission hasbeen considered as viable source of GRB prompt emission\cite{Freedman:2001,Spada:2000}. The difference between self-Comptonemission and mono-energetic inverse-Compton emission is the low-energyspectral index which is 1/3, similar to synchrotron emission. However,self-Compton and primary synchrotron emission differ in that the self-Compton spectrum has a much broader spectral curvature.\subsection{Sub-Photospheric Dissipation}\label{sec:subpht}The possibility for shocks to form below the photosphere arises fromthe fact that the range of outflow parameters allows for$r_{nt}<r_{ph}$ \cite{Peer:2005}. To illustrate, assume that energydissipation occurs at $r>r_s \equiv \eta r_0$. The minimum radius that internal shocks can form is\begin{equation}\label{eq:ri}r_i\approx 2\Gamma r_s.\end{equation}Assuming $L=10^{52}$ erg, and $r_0 = 6\times10^{6}$ cm correspondingto the last stable orbit of a stellar mass black hole. Using\equationref{eq:rph,eq:ri}, \figureref{fig:subph} shows the allowedvalues of $r_{\rm ph}$ and $r_i$.\begin{figure}[t]  \centering  \cfig{2}{subph}{4}      \caption{The allowed radii of internal shocks as a function of    $\Gamma$ are shown in the purple shaded region with the values of    $r_{\rm ph}$ indicated by the red line. It is evident that shocks    may form below the photosphere.}\label{fig:subph}\end{figure}This implies that internal shocks can form and dissipate energy intothe electrons before the jet becomes optically thin. In this scenario,the electrons are heated by the dissipated energy and a balancebetween Compton and inverse-Compton scattering occurs. If a low-energyphoton component such as a blackbody exists in this region of theoutflow, it will be upscattered to higher energies by the electronsthat have been heated by the dissipation. This component could explainthe observed non-thermal emission in GRBs. However, this model has yetto be able to explain the lightcurves and variability present in thedata.%%% Local Variables: %%% mode: latex%%% TeX-master: "../thesis"%%% End:
