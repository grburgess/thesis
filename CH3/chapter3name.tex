Together, they cover an energy range from 10 keV to300 GeV. This extensive bandpass allows for observing the entire$\gamma$-ray spectrum both above and below the $\vFv$ peak. The dataare readily available via the Fermi Science Support Center (FSSC)\cite{fssc}. A description of both instruments and their utilized datatypes follows.\subsection{GBM}The GBM consists of twelve Sodium Iodide (NaI) and two BismuthGerminate (BGO) detectors that cover an effective energy range of 10keV to 40 MeV. It continuously observes the non-Earth occulted skyexcept when entering the region of high charged particle activity knowas the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA). The instrument's main goal is totrigger when an increase in $\gamma$-ray counts is detected signalinga GRB event. The design and placement of the detectors around thespacecraft enables a coarse localization ($> 1^{\degree}$) of GRBs. Inthe event of an extremely bright detection, GBM can trigger anAutomated Repoint Request (ARR) that serves to point the LAT into anorientation that allows for pointed, spatially-resolved, high-energyemission observations.Detection of {\gray}s is possible via their conversion of into opticalwavelengths via scintillation \cite{knoll}. The {\gray} interacts witha scintillation crystal atom primarily by the photoelectriceffect, freeing an electron. The electron moves through the crystaland loses energy as it excites the surrounding ions that dexcite byemitting optical photons. These optical photons are measured by aphotomultiplier tube at the base of the crystal that converts theirsignal into an electrical pulse proportional to the incident \gray'senergy.The GBM is primarily a time-domain spectrometer. Three publiclyavailable data types from the GBM exist. These are CTIME, CSPEC, andTTE. CTIME is a high time-resolution (0.256 s) binned data with lowenergy resolution (8 channels). CSPEC is temporally-binned high energyresolution (128 channels) with a lower time resolution (4.096 s) thanCTIME. TTE data is event data with time-tags and a channel energy foreach individual detected count. CSPEC and CTIME are both continuouslymade during the spacecraft's orbit. Until recently, TTE was onlyavailable during GRB triggers; however, as of 2013 a flight softwareupgrade allows for the continuous generation of TTE data.\subsection{LAT}The LAT is a pair-conversion tracker that is primarily designed toimage $\gamma$-rays with energies $>10$ MeV. A pair-conversion trackeroperates by converting an incident $\gamma$-ray into anelectron-position pair ($e^{\pm}$) via a collision with a high-Zmaterial. The $e^{\pm}$ then moves in the same direction through thetracker where its trajectory is tracked with Silicon strips until itis finally absorbed in a calorimeter at the base. By reconstructingthe path of the $e^{\pm}$ and measuring the energy deposited in thecalorimeter, the direction and energy of the incident $\gamma$-ray canbe determined.The effective energy range of the LAT is 100 MeV - 300 GeV using thestandard event type data. However, a new data type named the LAT LowEnergy (LLE) data extends the energy range down to $\sim$30 MeV\cite{Vero:2010}. This data is made possible by collecting all counts in thedetector that pass basic cuts instead of rejecting counts that havepoor spatial and energy information. These poorly-measured events aretypically of lower energy. The side effect of accepting these eventsis a high background; therefore, the LLE data is only viable foranalyzing temporally transient events such as GRBs or pulsars.\section{Spectrum}\label{sec:spectrum}This focus of this work is on the prompt emission of GRBs. It isnecessary to draw a distinction between the prompt emission and theso-called afterglow which occurs after the primary high-energyemission. Discussion of the afterglow is beyond the scope of thisproject. To date, over 3000 GRBs have been observed by both BATSE and {\it  Fermi}. Several catalogs detail their spectral, temporal, andintensity properties\cite{Goldstein:2012,Kaneko:2006,Nava:2011}. These catalogs identifyseveral key features of the GRB population including their subdivisioninto two classes based on duration \cite{ck:1993}, the grouping oftheir respective $\vFv$ peak energies \cite{Schaefer:2003}, and theirdistribution of spectral indices. Key to all these findings are the parameters found via spectral analysis. The distribution ofphotons that make up the observed spectra of GRBs is one of the mainclues to understanding the physical mechanisms behind GRB emission.\subsection{The Band Function}\label{sec:bandfunc}Because of the inversion problem (see \sectionref{sec:ff}), it is impossible to directly assessthe shape of the photon spectrum. The shape of the typicalGRB spectrum is curved and asymptotically approaches a power-law athigh and low energies. A comprehensive study of empirical photonmodels fit to GRBs in the BATSE data found that a specialized functionwas able to fit the majority of time-integrated and time-resolvedspectra \cite{band:1993}. The Band function is a smoothly brokenpower-law connected exponentially at the $\vFv$ peak.\begin{equation}  \label{eq:band}   \Fv(\mathcal{E})\;=\;F_0  \begin{cases}    {\left(\frac{\mathcal{E}}{\rm 100\;keV}\right)^{\alpha} {\rm exp}\left(-\frac{(2+\alpha)\mathcal{E}}{E_{\rm p}}\right)} & {\mathcal{E}\le (\alpha-\beta)\frac{E_{\rm p}}{ (\alpha+2)} }\\    {\left(\frac{\mathcal{E}}{\rm 100\;keV}\right)^{\beta}{\rm        exp}{\left(\beta-\alpha\right)}\left[\frac{(\alpha-\beta)E_{\rm            p}}{{\rm 100\;keV} (2+\alpha)}\right]^{\alpha-\beta}} &    {\mathcal{E}>(\alpha-\beta)\frac{E_{\rm p}}{ (\alpha+2)} }  \end{cases}\end{equation}\begin{figure}[t]  \centering  \cfig{3}{bandExp}{5}  \caption{The $\vFv$ spectrum of the Band function illustrating its    three important shape parameters: $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\Ep$    (see \equationref{eq:band}).}  \label{fig:bandSpecEx}\end{figure}\begin{figure}[t]  \centering  \cfig{3}{band}{5}  \caption{Demonstrating the variety of Band function shapes    corresponding to differing values of $F_0$, $\alpha$, $\beta$, and    $\Ep$ (see \equationref{eq:band}).}  \label{fig:bandSpec}\end{figure}Nearly all GRBs detected by {\it Fermi} and BATSE can be fit with theBand function. Though the function is empirical, attempts have beenmade to relate its fit parameters to physical quantities. The mostimportant association was made by \cite{preece:1998} with theso-called synchrotron 'line-of-death'. As notedin \sectionref{sec:synctheory}, the low-energy slope (Band's $\alpha$index) of a synchrotron photon spectrum is -2/3. It found that nearly1/3 of GRB spectra had $\alpha$'s greater than -2/3 indicating thatthey were inconsistent with synchrotron emission(see \sectionref{sec:spec:lod} for a detailed discussion).\begin{figure}[h]  \centering \subfigure{\cfig{3}{epDist.pdf}{2.}}\subfigure{\cfig{3}{alpDist.pdf}{2.}}\subfigure{\cfig{3}{betaDist.pdf}{2.}}\caption{Band function fit parameters from the first two  years of GBM data.}  \label{fig:catparam}\end{figure}Similar associations with other emission mechanisms have beenmade. Much research has focused on finding an emission mechanism thatcan correctly account for the Band $\alpha$ distribution\cite{preece:1998,Beloborodov:2010,Daigne:2011,piran:2013}. To date,no one model can account for the entire parameter space. Similarly,E$_{\rm p}$ can be associated with radiative mechanisms through theirrespective physical $\vFv$ peaks e.g. see\equationref{eq:synchPeak}. The physical relation to $\beta$ istypically made to the power-law index of the emitting electrondistribution.\subsection{The Blackbody Component}With few exceptions \cite{gonzalez:2003,abdo+GRB090902B}, the spectraof GRBs were found to consist of only one broadband component in theBATSE era and the early {\it Fermi} era. The overall non-thermal shapeof GRB spectra fit with the Band function left little hope for findingthe thermal signature of a blackbody predicted by the basic fireballmodel. However, after the launch of {\it Fermi}, several GRBs weresatisfactorily fit with a two component model consisting of the Bandfunction and a blackbody\cite{guireic:2010,Axelsson:2012,guiriec:2013}. The component wasshown to be statistically significant. When fit along with ablackbody, the Band component of the spectra appeared to be moreconsistent with synchrotron than before with Band's $\alpha$ movingcloser to the expected value of the low-energy index.\begin{figure}[h]  \centering  \cfig{3}{vFv.pdf}{4}  \caption{The BATSE    era blackbody, which was fit to the entire spectrum is the same as    the GBM era blackbody due to the difference in bandpass of the    instruments.}  \label{fig:batseBB}\end{figure}Prior to the discovery of the blackbody component existing incombination with the Band function, several works studied theexistence of blackbodies in BATSE GRB spectra\cite{Ryde:2009,Ryde:2006,Ryde:2005,Ryde:2004}. These studies foundthat the entire GRB spectrum consisted of a blackbody or a blackbodyand a power-law extending into high energies. The evolution of thisblackbody component was studied extensively. It was found that thetemperature of the blackbody decayed as a broken power-law in timewith the index after the power-law break was typically $\sim-2/3$. Apost analysis of this component reveals that it is the same blackbodyfound in {\it Fermi} GRBs. This is because BATSE had a limitedhigh-energy response above 2 MeV (see\figureref{fig:batseBB}). Therefore, BATSE could only detect thelow-energy blackbody plus the low-energy power-law of the Bandfunction.\subsection{The Synchrotron Line-of-Death and the Fast Cooling Problem}\label{sec:spec:lod}The distribution of Band $\alpha$ has been studied extensively in anattempt to understand the underlying emission mechanisms. As shownin \sectionref{sec:emissionMech}, the low-energy index of a$\gamma$-ray spectrum is unique for many models. Synchrotron emissionfrom internal shocks is the simplest and most widely invoked model forexplaining GRB observations, however, the 'line-of-death' problempresents a challenge to the theory.\begin{figure}[h]  \centering  \cfig{3}{lod.pdf}{4}  \caption{The $\alpha$ distribution    of GBM detected GRBs illustrating the 'line-of-death' problem. The    fast-cooling line (\emph{blue}) and slow-cooling line (\emph{red})    are superimposed on the distribution.}  \label{fig:lod}\end{figure}GRBs fit with the Band function possessing $\alpha$'s greater than-2/3 are presumably inconsistent with synchrotron emission. Even moreproblematic is that nearly \emph{all} GRBs have $\alpha$'s greaterthan -3/2, the fast-cooling synchrotron index. Due to the time scalesinvolved, the electrons in GRBs must be in the fast-cooling regime. Ifthe cooling timescale argument is ignored then the problem ofefficiency forces the requirement of fast cooling for the internalshock model. The low dissipation efficiency of internal shocks(5-20\%) is the upper limit of the radiative efficiency, i.e., if theradiative efficiency is 100\%, then only 5-20\% of bulk kinetic energyof the jet can be radiated in the form of {\gray}s. Slow-coolingelectrons are much less efficient than those that are being quicklycooled by synchrotron; therefore, the internal shock model requiresfast-cooling to be radiatively efficient. This is the so-calledfast-cooling problem.\subsection{Spectral Evolution}\label{sec:spec:evo}The evolution of spectral parameters in GRBs is useful in identifyingthe evolution of the jet structure and/or the evolution of themagnetic field during the outflow. The most well studied parameterevolution is the that of $\Ep$\cite{Medvedev:2006,Liang:1997,Liang:1996,golenetskii:1983,Ryde:2001}. Whilethere is no universal evolution of $\Ep$, many GRBs exhibit theso-called hard-to-soft evolution, i.e., the monotonic evolution of$\Ep$ from an initially high value to a lower value. The physicalexplanation of this evolution is not fully understood and will beaddressed in \sectionref{sec:results:hec,sec:fluxfrx}. Accompanying hard-to-soft evolution is thecorrelation of $\Ep$ with $\Fv$ in many bursts. This correlation ismost prominent in single-pulsed GRBs. This hardness-intensitycorrelation (HIC) is also not fully understood but should be relatedto the radial change in the GRB jet parameters \cite{preece:2013}.\section{Lightcurves}\begin{figure}[h]  \centering  \cfig{3}{lc.pdf}{6}  \caption{A sample of GBM lightcurves    demonstrating the diversity of pulse shape and complexity    \cite{valerieSite}. For this study, the concentration will be on    single pulsed GRBs such as GRB 110605183 (above).}  \label{fig:gbmlc}\end{figure}The varied nature of GRB lightcurves is impossible to describecategorically (see \figureref{fig:gbmlc}). There are; however, asubclass of lightcurves that have been studied intensely\cite{Ruiz:2000,Fenimore:1996,Dermer:2004,Norris:1999}. These arethose with a fast rise and exponential decay (FREDs) in time. GRBs with wellseparated FRED pulses have very similar properties in their associatedspectral evolution. The FRED shape has not been fully explained bytheory. The simplest explanation comes from special relativity. If aspherical source emitting photons isotropically expandsrelativistically, then it can be shown that the observer from pulseresembles that of a FRED \cite{Rees:1966}. Studies of FRED pulses haveshown that this simple model cannot account for all FRED shapes\cite{Kocevski:2003}. The relation of the rise and decay times ofpulses should give an indication of the emission model of GRB pulses\cite{Kocevski:2003}; however, no unique solution for the associationof pulse shape has been established.For this work, the focus will be on GRBs with single, separable pulsesthat have FRED-like shapes. These GRBs have been shown to have simpleand clean spectral evolution \cite{Ryde:2009} which is imperative for the studyof physical emission models.\section{Simulations of GRB Emission}\label{sec:sims}In order to understand the observations and their relation to theory,several theoretical models have been numerically simulated andcompared to observed spectra and lightcurves\cite{Daigne:1998,Daigne:2009,Asano:2009,Pana:1998,Chiang:1999,Cannizzo:2004,Peer:2005,Kobayashi:1997}. Thesimulations typically attempt to assess either the dynamic evolutionof the jet or the emission of the electrons that have been acceleratedand their evolution. Some simulations attempt to address bothproperties. The internal shock model has received the most attentionvia simulation due to its relative simplicity compared to othermodels.\subsection{Simulations of the Internal Shock Model}To simulate the internal shock model, the dynamics derivedin \sectionref{sec:nter:is} must be numerically calculated for a largenumber of emitted shells. The first attempts to do so were simplisticand attempted to simulate the shape and variability of the typical GRBlightcurve only \cite{Kobayashi:1997}. These studies showed that theinternal shock model could reproduce the observed lightcurve shapesbut gave no information about the spectra. The next set of simulationsenhanced these results by including synchrotron emission and thenlater a full radiative code that included all radiative processesrelevant to GRB emission \cite{Daigne:1998,Daigne:2009}.These simulations consist of a large number of shells of varying massand $\Gamma$. They are emitted one after another with faster shellscoming after the slower shells in time. This forces a collision where thedissipated energy is calculated from \equationref{eq:intEne}. Thisdissipated energy is then used to numerically calculate an acceleratedelectron distribution that cools via a radiative code thatnumerically calculates:\begin{equation}  \label{eq:coolingcode}  \dover{\partial n_e}{\partial t^{\prime}}= - \dover{\partial}{\partial \gamma}\left[\dover{\mathrm{d}\gamma}{\mathrm{d} t^{\prime}}\bigg|_{{\rm sync} + {\rm ic}}n_e(\gamma,t^{\prime})\right]\end{equation}As the electrons cool, the radiation spectrum is calculated from thedifferent radiative emissivities. The radiative codes used in thesesimulations are simple to increase the speed of computation due tothe large number of shell collisions involved. Once the radiationspectrum is calculated in the GRB jet rest frame, the emission istransformed into the observer frame. The total emission from the jetis then summed together forming a lightcurve. These lightcurves andtheir associated spectra have been shown to reproduce many of theobserved features of GRBs including hard-to-soft evolution, Band-likeshape, and lightcurve shape. This success has helped to answer manyquestions about viable mechanisms for producing GRBs. However, thesesimulations rely on many processes that are put in by hand and notself-consistent. These include the particle acceleration and radiativetimescales. While these simplifications aid in decreasing CPU time,they neglect key questions which must be self-consistently validatedin order to fully assess the viability of the internal shock model.\subsection{Full Radiative Codes and Sub-Photospheric Dissipation}A fully self-consistent radiative code can calculate the evolution ofaccelerated electrons as they cool from the various emissionmechanisms relevant to GRBs. The most complete radiative code in theliterature is that of \cite{Peer:2005}. In these simulations of GRBemission, an injected electron distribution is tracked as it cools ina very detailed manner. Different radiative processes occur atdifferent timescales making the calculations numerically challengingand CPU intensive. Therefore, this code neglects the GRB jet dynamicsimplemented in \cite{Daigne:2009}. Still, these simulations show thatthe evolution of the electron distribution is highly complex and thesimplifications made in \cite{Daigne:1998,Daigne:2009} neglectimportant aspects of the radiative process. Ideally, a fully detailedradiative code should be coupled with a full jet dynamics code tofully understand the internal shock model. The simulation collects theassociated radiation from the electrons and computes the observedspectra and its evolution. These spectra can then be compared to data.One key benefit of this full radiative code is that it can simulatethe evolution of electrons when the particle densities imply a high opticaldepth. This allows for testing of the sub-photospheric dissipationmodel. It has been shown that the spectra produced by this model canhave Band-like shapes. However, due to the limitations discussed aboveno lightcurve has been produced to show that the model is fullyconsistent with observations.\subsection{Simulations of PFD and Magnetic Reconnection in GRBs}Due to the lack of theoretical understanding of magnetic reconnectionand PFD models, very little simulation work has been done in the fieldof GRBs to test their viability as an emission mechanism. No lightcurves or spectra have been numerically simulated andtherefore, no evaluation of the validity of these models can bemade. The association of these models to data has been made purely onconsiderations of timescales and energy requirements that fall intothe expected GRB regime but detailed simulations must be carried outto validate these models fully.% \section{Tables---Kinda like Figures in Reverse}% In the UAH format, table require ``titles'' (where figures require% ``captions'').
