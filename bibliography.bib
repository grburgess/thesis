	Abstract = {The prompt emission spectra of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) usually have a dominant component that is well described by a phenomenological Band function. The physical origin of this spectral component is debated. Although the traditional interpretation is synchrotron radiation of non-thermal electrons accelerated in internal shocks or magnetic dissipation regions, the growing trend within the community is to interpret this component as modified thermal emission from a dissipative photosphere of a GRB fireball. We analyze the time-dependent spectrum of GRB 110721A detected by the Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor and Large Area Telescope, and pay special attention to the rapid evolution of the peak energy Ep . We define a "death line" of thermally dominated dissipative photospheric emission in the Ep -L plane, and show that Ep of GRB 110721A at the earliest epoch has a very high Ep \~{} 15 MeV that is beyond the "death line." Together with the finding that an additional "shoulder" component exists in this burst that is consistent with a photospheric origin, we suggest that at least for some bursts, the Band component is not from a dissipative photosphere, but must invoke a non-thermal origin (e.g., synchrotron or inverse Compton) in the optically thin region of a GRB outflow. We also suggest that the rapid hard-to-soft spectral evolution is consistent with the quick discharge of magnetic energy in a magnetically dominated outflow in the optically thin region.},

@article{Ryde2004,
	Abstract = {We discuss gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that have very hard spectra, consistent with blackbody radiation. Several emission components are expected, on the basis of theoretical considerations, to be visible in the gamma-ray band, mainly nonthermal emission from cooling, relativistic electrons and thermal emission from a wind photosphere. We find that the pulses we study are consistent with a thermal blackbody radiation throughout their duration and that the temperature kT can be well described by a broken power law as a function of time, with an initially constant temperature or weak decay (\~{}100 keV). After the break, most cases are consistent with a decay with index -. A few of the pulses have a weak nonthermal component overlaying the thermal one and are better fitted with a combination of a thermal and a nonthermal component. We further demonstrate that such a two-component model can explain the whole time evolution of other bursts that are found to be thermal only initially and later become nonthermal. The relative strengths between the two components vary with time, and this is suggested, among other things, to account for the change in the modeled low-energy power-law slope that is often observed in GRBs. The secondary, nonthermal components are consistent with optically thin synchrotron emission in the cooling regime. We interpret the observations within a model of an optically thick shell (fireball) that expands adiabatically. The slow, or absent, temperature decrease is in the acceleration phase, during which the bulk Lorentz factor increases, and the faster temperature decay is reached as the flow saturates and starts to coast with a constant speed. We also discuss a Poynting-flux model, in which the saturation radius is reached close to the photosphere. Even though these observations cannot tell these models apart, the latter has several attractive advantages. The GLAST satellite will be able to clarify and further test the physical setting of similar thermal pulses.},

@article{Peer2012,
	Abstract = {ABSTRACT Photospheric (thermal) emission is inherent to the gamma-ray burst (GRB) 'fireball' model. We show here that inclusion of this component in the analysis of the GRB prompt emission phase naturally explains some of the prompt GRB spectra seen by the Fermi satellite over its entire energy band. The sub-MeV peak is explained as multicolour blackbody emission, and the high-energy tail, extending up to the GeV band, results from roughly similar contributions of synchrotron emission, synchrotron self-Compton and Comptonization of the thermal photons by energetic electrons originating after dissipation of the kinetic energy above the photosphere. We show how this analysis method results in a complete, self-consistent picture of the physical conditions at both emission sites of the thermal and non-thermal radiation. We study the connection between the thermal and non-thermal parts of the spectrum, and show how the values of the free model parameters are deduced from the data. We demonstrate our analysis method on GRB 090902B: we deduce a Lorentz factor in the range 920 ≤$\eta$≤ 1070, photospheric radius rph≃ 7.2-8.4 × 10 cm and dissipation radius r$\gamma$≥ 3.5-4.1 × 10 cm. By comparison to afterglow data, we deduce that a large fraction $\epsilon$d≈ 85-95 per cent of the kinetic energy is dissipated, and that a large fraction, ∼ equipartition of this energy, is carried by the electrons and the magnetic field. This high value of $\epsilon$d questions the 'internal shock' scenario as the main energy dissipation mechanism for this GRB. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@article{Zhang2011,
	Abstract = {The recent Fermi observation of GRB 080916C shows that the bright photosphere emission associated with a putative fireball is missing, which suggests that the central engine likely launches a Poynting-flux-dominated (PFD) outflow. We propose a model of gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission in the PFD regime, namely, the Internal-Collision-induced MAgnetic Reconnection and Turbulence (ICMART) model. It is envisaged that the GRB central engine launches an intermittent, magnetically dominated wind, and that in the GRB emission region, the ejecta is still moderately magnetized (e.g., 1  $\sigma$  100). Similar to the internal shock (IS) model, the mini-shells interact internally at the radius R IS \~{} $\Gamma$2 c$\Delta$t. Most of these early collisions, however, have little energy dissipation, but serve to distort the ordered magnetic field lines entrained in the ejecta. At a certain point, the distortion of magnetic field configuration reaches the critical condition to allow fast reconnection seeds to occur, which induce relativistic MHD turbulence in the interaction regions. The turbulence further distorts field lines easing additional magnetic reconnections, resulting in a runway release of the stored magnetic field energy (an ICMART event). Particles are accelerated either directly in the reconnection zone, or stochastically in the turbulent regions, which radiate synchrotron photons that power the observed gamma rays. Each ICMART event corresponds to a broad pulse in the GRB light curve, and a GRB is composed of multiple ICMART events. This model retains the merits of IS and other models, but may overcome several difficulties/issues faced by the IS model (e.g., low efficiency, fast cooling, electron number excess, Amati/Yonetoku relation inconsistency, and missing bright photosphere). Within this model, the observed GRB variability timescales could have two components, one slow component associated with the central engine time history, and another fast component associated with relativistic magnetic turbulence in the emission region. The model predicts a decrease of gamma-ray polarization degree and Ep  in each ICMART event (broad pulse) during the prompt GRB phase, as well as a moderately magnetized external reverse shock. The model may be applied to the GRBs that have time-resolved, featureless Band-function spectra, such as GRB 080916C and most GRBs detected by Fermi LAT.},
