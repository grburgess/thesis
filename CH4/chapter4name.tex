The Bandfunction has suggested a viable, comprehensive physical origin since itscanonical use in the fitting of GRBs. The first problem comes from thefact that GRB spectra are fit with the forward-folding method. Thismethod assumes a model a priori and then convolves this model with thedetector response matrix to produce a count spectrum that is fit to the observed countdata. Therefore, the initial assumption of a photon model limits theallowed shape parameters that can be tested because the photon modelis essentially imprinted on the data from the start. The Band functionapproximates many non-thermal photon models, but it is not exact. Thecurvature of the Band function around the $\vFv$ peak of the spectrumis fixed by its spectral shape and differs from the curvature ofactual models such as synchrotron. The association of the Bandfunction parameters with physical models has typically been via thelow-energy $\alpha$ index. However, this association neglects thecurvature of the physical model. A comparison of Band shapes todifferent physical models is shown in \figureref{fig:bandCompPhys}.\begin{figure}[h]  \centering  \subfigure{\cfig{4}{bandMods.pdf}{2.95}}  \subfigure{\cfig{4}{mods.pdf}{2.95}}  \caption{A comparison a physical photon spectra (\emph{left}) and    their associated Band function approximations (\emph{right})    demonstrates the problems of using the Band function parameters to    infer a physical emission model from observed spectra.}  \label{fig:bandCompPhys}\end{figure}The varying curvature of these modelscan result in the false association of Band $\alpha$ to a physicalorigin depending on where the Band $\vFv$ peak falls with respect tothe curvature of the physical model. The danger of relating Band to physical models becomes very apparentwhen comparing fast and slow-cooling synchrotron models. Slow-coolingpredicts $\alpha=-2/3$ while fast-cooling predicts $\alpha=-3/2$. If aspectrum is fit with the Band function and an $\alpha\sim -3/2$ ismeasured, the conclusion that the spectrum results from fast-coolingsynchrotron could be made in error. This is because the $\vFv$curvature of the Band function is much narrower than that of thefast-cooling synchrotron even when they possess the same low-energyindex. These issues imply that a new method for assessing the physicalorigin of GRB spectra is required. The approach in this work is to fitnumerical physical models directly to the GRB count data to make adirect association of the data to a model.\section{Historical Fitting of Physical Models to Data}The first attempt to fit GRB data with physical models was made by\cite{Baring:2004} (hereafter, BB04). In this work numericalevaluations of physical emissivities convolved with an electrondistribution resulted in photon models that were fit to GRB photonspectra that had been deconvolved with the Band function (see\figureref{fig:bb04}). While enlightening, this study suffered fromthe limitation that the photon data that was fit had been deconvolvedwith an empirical function first. This means that the data alreadyhad the shape of the Band function imprinted on it. Therefore,incorrect conclusions were drawn about the validity of these physicalphoton models. Since the Band function's curvature was imprinted onthe data, the broader synchrotron curvature was unable to fit the datawithout converging on non-physical values for the electrondistribution. The solution to this problem is to implement physicalmodels directly into the forward-folding scheme and is the main focusof this work.\begin{figure}[h]  \centering  \cfig{4}{bb04.pdf}{5.5}  \caption{Examples of physical model fitting to deconvolved BATSE $\vFv$    spectra from \cite{Baring:2004}.}  \label{fig:bb04}\end{figure}\section{Numerical Physical Fitting in RMFIT}For all spectral fitting in this work, the publicly-available analysispackage, {\tt RMFIT} \cite{rmfit} was used. {\tt RMFIT} is acombination of IDL and FORTRAN code that is able to read GBM and LATdata and fit photon models to the counts data. The graphical interfaceis written in IDL and the fitting engine, {\tt MFIT}, is inFORTRAN. {\tt MFIT} utilizes a Levenberg-Marquardt minimizationroutine \cite{numrecipes} to minimize a chosen fitting statistic(e.g. {\chisq}, log-likelihood) to optimize the spectral parameters ofa given photon model to the data. It is optimized to work with GBMcounts data and was chosen over the fitting package {\tt XSPEC}\cite{xspec} because of its close association with the GBM datatypes. {\tt RMFIT} contains several photon fit models but lacks thephysical models required for this study. Therefore, custom FORTRANmodules had to be designed to enable the fitting of these models todata.\subsection{Physical Models in MFIT}\label{sec:physmod:rmfit}To enable the fitting of physical models in {\tt RMFIT}, the sourcecode of {\tt MFIT} was extended to contain the following models:\begin{itemize}\item slow-cooling synchrotron\item fast-cooling synchrotron\item inverse-compton from a mono-energetic seed source\item synchrotron self-compton.\end{itemize}For all models, numeric integration was required. To add thisfunctionality into {\tt MFIT} the numeric integration routines of theGNU Scientific Library (GSL) \cite{gsl} were added to the {\tt MFIT}source code. These routines were written in C, and therefore, aFORTRAN/C interface code was designed that allowed for the passing ofvariables between GSL and {\tt MFIT}.For each photon model, the emitting electron distribution must be numericallyevaluated. For all models except the slow and fast-cooled synchrotron model apower-law was chosen for the electron distribution. For theslow-cooled synchrotron model, the distribution of\equationref{eq:elec_dist} was used, consisting of a relativisticMaxwellian with a high-energy power-law tail. The fast-cooled electron distribution (\equationref{eq:necool}) was used for fast-cooled synchrotron. The electrondistribution is then numerically convolved with single particleemissivity of the selected photon model. The functional form of thephoton models are then added to the list of the {\tt MFIT} photonmodels. When {\tt MFIT} calls the models for parameter optimization, anumerical evaluation of the model is made at each energy bin of thecounts data. The parameters of the photon model are compared with thedata and the process is iterated until the fitting statistic convergesto a minimum. This process is very CPU intensive compared to fittingempirical models.The fit parameters of each photon model are listed here:\begin{itemize}\item slow-cooled synchrotron  \begin{itemize}  \item total normalization (A)  \item power-law normalization ($\epsilon$)  \item thermal electron Lorentz factor ($\gamth$)  \item power-law electron Lorentz factor ($\gammaMin$)  \item electron spectral index ($\delta$)    \item peak energy ($\Ep$)  \end{itemize}\item fast-cooled synchrotron  \begin{itemize}  \item total normalization (A)    \item power-law electron Lorentz factor ($\gammaMin$)  \item electron spectral index ($\delta$)    \item peak energy ($\Ep$)  \end{itemize}\item mono-energetic inverse-Compton  \begin{itemize}  \item total normalization (A)    \item power-law electron Lorentz factor ($\gammaMin$)  \item electron spectral index ($\delta$)    \item peak energy ($\Ep$)  \end{itemize}\item synchrotron self-Compton  \begin{itemize}  \item total normalization (A)    \item power-law electron Lorentz factor ($\gammaMin$)  \item electron spectral index ($\delta$)    \item peak energy ($\Ep$)  \end{itemize}\end{itemize}These physical models are very rigid and difficult to fit to the datacompared to the Band function. The fitting engine will often failcompletely when fitting models that are very different from thedata. This is the case for the inverse Compton and self-Comptonmodels. For this reason, they will be left out of the discussion andwe will focus on the synchrotron based models. An important difficulty arises when trying to fit these models to thedata. The number of free parameters greatly exceeds the number ofparameters that can be simultaneously constrained. To alleviate theseproblems, the models have to be formulated such that the degeneraciesin the shape parameters do not exist. This reformulation is detailedfor the synchrotron model in \appendixref{ch:degen}.%%% Local Variables: %%% mode: latex%%% TeX-master: "../thesis"%%% End:
