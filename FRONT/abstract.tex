Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most energetic events in the Universe
but the processes that generate their observed $\gamma$-ray emission
remain unknown. Much of what is known about these processes comes from
fits of the empirical Band function to the photon spectra of
GRBs. However, very little information about the emission mechanisms
can be derived from these empirical fits because extrapolation of
fitted Band parameters to physical photon models is often degenerate
due to the similar shapes of these models.  In this work, physical
models of high-energy radiation mechanisms are numerically implemented
into a data fitting framework in order to test these models on
Gamma-ray Burst (GRB) data from the {\it Fermi} Gamma-ray Space
Telescope. The resulting fit parameters are used to explore the
structure, mechanisms, and evolution of GRB jets to gain a better
understanding of how these relatively unexplained events
occur. Evaluations of plausible models are made from the inferred
properties of the jets enabling a full physical view of the evolution
of GRBs from the event horizon of the parent black hole to the very
edge of the jet.
